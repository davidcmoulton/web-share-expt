  <h1>Web sharing exploration</h1>
    <p>
      The aim is to register a web share target with a user agent (e.g. a mobile phone in this case), enabling the user to choose
      what to share with it via their device's standard sharing mechanism.
    </p>
    <p>Tested on a physical OnePlus 8 Pro using Chrome.</p>

    First, <a href="gubbins/target/index.html">install the progressive web app</a> that that will become the web share target.
    Come back here when you're done.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now you can use your device's standard sharing system to share things with the share target - look for it in your
    device's share list. <a href="gubbins/web-share.html">Try out the sharing tool over here.</a>
